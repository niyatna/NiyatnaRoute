# Compression Engines

OmniRoute compression is built around engine contracts. A mode can run one engine directly
(`caveman` or `rtk`) or a deterministic stacked pipeline that executes multiple engines in order.

## Modes

| Mode         | Engine path                        | Intended input                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `off`        | none                               | Exact prompt preservation                    |
| `lite`       | Caveman lite helpers               | Low-risk always-on cleanup                   |
| `standard`   | Caveman                            | Natural-language prompt condensation         |
| `aggressive` | Caveman + history/tool summarizers | Long chat sessions                           |
| `ultra`      | Caveman + pruning helpers          | Context-limit recovery                       |
| `rtk`        | RTK                                | Terminal, shell, build, test, and git output |
| `stacked`    | Pipeline, default `rtk -> caveman` | Mixed tool logs and prose                    |

## Engine Registry

The registry lives in `open-sse/services/compression/engines/registry.ts`. Engines expose a shared
contract:

- `id`: stable engine id such as `caveman` or `rtk`
- `label`: dashboard-readable name
- `supports(mode)`: whether the engine can execute a compression mode
- `compress(input)`: transforms text/messages and returns stats

`strategySelector.ts` registers the built-in engines before compression runs. This lets preview,
runtime compression, stacked mode, tests, and future engines use the same execution path.

## Caveman

Caveman mode focuses on semantic condensation of normal prose:

- preserves code blocks, URLs, JSON, paths, and structured data
- removes filler, hedging, repeated context, and verbose connective phrasing
- supports language-aware file rule packs in `open-sse/services/compression/rules/`
- remains available through the legacy `standard`, `aggressive`, and `ultra` modes

The dashboard surface is `Dashboard -> Context & Cache -> Caveman`.

## RTK

RTK mode focuses on command and tool output:

- detects output classes such as `git status`, `git branch`, `git diff`, Vitest/Jest/Pytest,
  Cargo/Go tests, TypeScript/Vite/Webpack builds, ESLint, npm audit/installs, Docker logs,
  shell `find`/`grep`, stack traces, and generic logs
- applies 49 JSON filters from `open-sse/services/compression/engines/rtk/filters/`
- supports the RTK-style declarative pipeline: ANSI stripping, replace, match-output short-circuit,
  strip/keep lines, per-line truncation, head/tail/max-line truncation, and on-empty fallback
- supports trust-gated project filters in `.rtk/filters.json` and global filters in
  `DATA_DIR/rtk/filters.json`
- strips ANSI sequences, progress noise, repeated lines, and unhelpful boilerplate
- preserves actionable failures, warnings, summaries, changed files, and tail context
- can optionally retain redacted raw output for recovery/debugging through authenticated management
  routes

The dashboard surface is `Dashboard -> Context & Cache -> RTK`.

Operational details for custom filters, trust, verify, and raw-output recovery live in
[`RTK_COMPRESSION.md`](RTK_COMPRESSION.md).

## Stacked Pipelines

Stacked mode runs pipeline steps in order. The default is:

```txt
rtk -> caveman
```

Use this for coding-agent sessions where a prompt combines command output with human or assistant
prose. RTK reduces noisy tool logs first, then Caveman compresses remaining natural language.

Pipeline steps are configured with `stackedPipeline` in compression settings or through compression
combos.

## Compression Combos

Compression combos are named compression profiles that can be assigned to routing combos:

- `compression_combos`: stores mode, pipeline, RTK config, language config, and default marker
- `compression_combo_assignments`: maps a compression combo to a routing combo
- runtime integration resolves an assigned compression combo before generic combo overrides
- analytics include `compression_combo_id` and `engine`

Dashboard surface: `Dashboard -> Context & Cache -> Compression Combos`.

## API Surface

Management routes require management authentication or API-key policy checks.

## MCP Tools

Compression exposes five MCP tools:

| Tool                                | Scope               | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `omniroute_compression_status`      | `read:compression`  | Settings, analytics, cache stats |
| `omniroute_compression_configure`   | `write:compression` | Update global settings           |
| `omniroute_set_compression_engine`  | `write:compression` | Set mode and optional pipeline   |
| `omniroute_list_compression_combos` | `read:compression`  | List compression combos          |
| `omniroute_compression_combo_stats` | `read:compression`  | Read combo/engine analytics      |
